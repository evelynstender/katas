### Restrospective 1

- Are you keeping up with the requirements? Has any iteration been a big challenge?
  - The biggest challenge was to thing about how distance/range would work
  - The requirements seems pretty clear and easy to follow

- Do you feel good about your design? Is it scalable and easily adapted to new requirements?
  - I feel quite confident in the design, even though I think there's loads to be refactored. I just couldn't find the pattern to do a refactor yet.

- Is everything tested? Are you confident in your code?
  - Everything is tested as TDD is being used. Every little requirement on each itereation is being tested.
  - Code is quite messy, but I'm confident that is matching all the requirements until now


### Restrospective 2

- What problems did you encounter?
  - I found some issue on how to differentiate between a character and a thing, how I would structure that.

- What have you learned? Any new technique or pattern?
  I learnt more about types and how to use them, the benefits of extending a class.
